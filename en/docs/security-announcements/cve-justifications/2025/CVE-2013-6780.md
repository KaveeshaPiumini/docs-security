### REPORTED VULNERABILITY
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in `uploader.swf` in the Uploader component in Yahoo! YUI 2.5.0 through 2.9.0 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the `allowedDomain` parameter.

### REPORTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 API Manager : 3.2.0, 3.2.1, 4.0.0, 4.1.0, 4.2.0, 4.3.0, 4.4.0, 4.5.0

### WSO2 JUSTIFICATION

CVE-2013-6780 describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `uploader.swf` file associated with the Yahoo! YUI Uploader component, affecting versions 2.5.0 through 2.9.0. The vulnerability arises when malicious input is passed to the `allowedDomain` parameter of the Flash-based uploader component, which could result in the execution of arbitrary web script in the context of the victim’s session[^1].

WSO2 API Manager includes YUI as a front-end library within its **Carbon Console**, primarily for rendering UI elements such as menus, tabs, and dialog boxes. This inclusion is limited to the `org.wso2.carbon.ui` component. While the YUI library is present, the vulnerable **Uploader** module and its corresponding `uploader.swf` file are neither used nor packaged in any API-M product distribution.

Specifically:

- **No invocation of vulnerable code:** The API Manager’s Carbon Console does not reference or embed the `YAHOO.widget.Uploader` class or any related Flash integration. Upload functionality is implemented using native HTTP POST actions, not Flash widgets.

- **`uploader.swf` is not present:** The `uploader.swf` file is not included, served, or referenced in any WSO2 API Manager product build or runtime distribution.

- **Secure, server-side upload handling:** All file uploads are processed via authenticated Admin Services on the server side. These services operate independently of YUI and do not rely on any Flash or client-side upload components.

- **Minimal exposure surface:** The Carbon Console is an administrative interface, typically protected by authentication and enterprise network controls. Even in accessible deployments, the absence of `uploader.swf` ensures no exploitable vector exists.

- **Mitigation alignment by design:** Yahoo’s advisory to remove `uploader.swf` is satisfied by default in WSO2 distributions, as the file has never been packaged or distributed[^2].

Given the above, WSO2 concludes that although YUI library present in the Carbon Console, the vulnerable functionality (`uploader.swf`) is not present, exposed, or used in any API Manager deployment. Therefore, CVE-2013-6780 **does not apply** to the listed versions of WSO2 API Manager, and no remediation or dependency upgrade is required in response to this CVE.


### CONCLUSION
- The `uploader.swf` file is not present in any WSO2 API Manager distribution.  
- The YUI Uploader component is not used or referenced within the Carbon Console.  
- All file upload functionality is implemented securely via server-side Admin Services, without reliance on Flash-based components.

Therefore, WSO2 concludes that **this is not a vulnerability present in aforementioned WSO2 products**, and **a dependency upgrade will not be carried out solely based on the detection of CVE-2013-6780**.
