### REPORTED VULNERABILITY
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Flash component infrastructure in YUI 2.5.0 through 2.8.1, as used in Bugzilla, Moodle, and other products, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via vectors related to `uploader/assets/uploader.swf`.

### WSO2 JUSTIFICATION
According to the CVE, the reported XSS vulnerability is specific to a file named `uploader.swf`, which is used for handling file uploads. This file is not included in WSO2 product distributions. As a result, there is no possibility of accessing or exploiting this file within our products, ensuring that the vulnerability does not pose any security risk to WSO2 users.

### CONCLUSION
- `uploader.swf` is not used in WSO2 products.

Therefore, WSO2 concludes that **this is not a vulnerability present in aforementioned WSO2 products**, and **a dependency upgrade will not be carried out solely based on the detection of CVE-2010-4208**.
