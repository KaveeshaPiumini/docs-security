### OVERVIEW
The deprecated **Try-It** feature has been removed to address a SSRF vulnerability that could be chained to a XSS flow.


### DESCRIPTION
The legacy **Try-It** feature which was accessible only to users with administrative privileges, accepted user supplied URLs without validation. This could result in potential Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). Since the retrieved content is incorporated directly into HTML responses, this could also be used in performing a reflected cross-site scripting within the admin user’s browser context.


### IMPACT
**Combined SSRF & XSS**: By tricking an administrator into accessing a crafted URL, an attacker can force the server to fetch malicious content, which is then reflected in the user’s browser allowing arbitrary script execution to modify the UI or exfiltrate data. 

Note that session cookies are protected with the HttpOnly flag, mitigating direct session hijacking.

**Internal Service Enumeration**: If a malicious actor with administrative privileges visits a specially crafted link, SSRF may be used to query non-public endpoints reachable to the WSO2 product deployment, aiding in mapping internal network resources.


### SOLUTION

This release improves product security by removing the **Try-It** feature, the root cause of SSRF and XSS vulnerabilities, reducing the attack surface.
